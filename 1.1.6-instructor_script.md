##Activity 1.1.6

-----------------------

### Goal: Final check of student's understanding of the 2 models

##A FNT 1.1.3-4 Total energy of a system

* **Explain whether ice or water at melting point has more total energy**

###Class Discussion
* **Who can show us their energy-system diagram and explain whether ice or water at 0 deg C
has more energy? (water)**
* Make sure the group uses the logic of the model to explain

## B 1.1.3-5 Heat
* ID that heat is a change in energy
* **Compare your answers with the rest of your small group - discuss any differences you find**

### Class Discusion
* **Who wants to explain to the class whether an energy system can contain a certain amount of heat?**
* *historically heat means thermal energy, but current books and our class will mean a change
in energy of the system*

## C FNT 1.1.3-6 Thermal equilibrium of water and copper
* **Do a) and b). Put a 3 phase diagram and energy-system diragram on the board**

### Class discusion
* **a) Who can present their 3 phase diagram to the class? How can you tell if a either substance
undergoes a phase change**
* **b) Can another group explain their energy system diagram? What is the delta E_thermal of water? Why?**
	* T can be more extreme then initial conditions
	* discuss how you know the sign of the energies in the equation
	* water thermal E is neg.
	* **Why was it important to ask part b) after part a)?** (you have to know what energy
		systems are involved)
* **Do FNT 1.1.6 Cc using the new initial conditions in FNT 1.1.3c (water is in gas phase)**
	* Compare the energy of Cu to reach 100 deg C w/ energy lost by water when it completes its phase change
	* **don't need to worry about conversion from K to C**
	* **assume you have equal amounts of Cu and water**

###Class discussion
* **Did the water undergo a phase and/or temperature change? How did you determine this?**
* No phase change - watch units
* what if the energy from copper were larger? then water completes phase change and starts to cool to thermal equilibrium
