##Activity 2.1.2

-----------------------

### Goal: Introduce Spring PE and oscillator model

##A) Observing the mass on a spring

* **Perform the experiments and answer the questions in A #1 and #2**

###Class Discusion:

* **Who can share their energy interaction diagram for the spring?**
* **Where is the mass moving the fastest?** (equilibrium point)
* **Where is the speed zero?**
* If students have trouble - think of a swing
* don't include gravity

##B) Turn observations into an energy interaction diagram

* **Make an energy interaction diagram for the spring from it's initial displacement to its equilibrium point**

###Class Discussion:

* **Who wants to share their energy interaction diagram?**
* make sure students are ok with PE = 0 at end and KE = 0 at start

##C)
* **Answer questions 5 and 6 on the board**

###Class Discussion:

* **Which indicators depend on magnitude only and which require direction?**
	* PEsm x is squared --> mag only
	* KE mag only
* **Does it matter if I measure the final state at the first, third, or 200th time the mass passes through equilibrium?**
	* What do you observe? displacement from equilibrium point is less and less --> losing energy to heat
	* Some energy lost to heat, so eventually it matters. Plot heat loss vs oscillation and accuracy of instrument to determine when

* **How is the work we did with internal energies similar to the work done with mechanical energy?**
