##Activity 1.1.8

-----------------------

### Goal:
Apply the Energy Interaction Model to closed systems with bond and thermal energy

##A) FNT 1.1.4-3: add salt to water/ice mixture --> more water

* **Draw an energy system diagram on the board for process of adding salt to mixed ice and water**

###Class Discussion

* **Can someone explain their energy diagram system and tell us what information was given and what was inferred?**
	* know change in temp
	* infer change in mass of liquid
	* know closed system

##B) FNT 1.1.4-4: Experiment with measuring the melting point of salt water

* **Make a list on the board of the low temperatures your group attained**
* **Discuss if it would be good to memorize: "When bond energy increases, thermal energy must
decrease, and vice versa. Record on board**

###Class Discussion

* **What temperatures did different groups attain?**
	* should be between -13 -> -21
* **Should you memorize the phrase?**
	* no, only applies to a closed system

##C) FNT 1.2.1-5: heating water in a microwave

* **Create a plot of Power vs mass of water with all of the reading of the class on the board**
* **Where did the missing power go?**

###Class Discussion

* **What is power? Explain your Y axis**
* **Missing power is in thermal energy**
* **What does the graph look this way?**
* **If necessary: There is an intermediate mass at which your system is most efficient. Like
riding a bike and getting the gears right so that the energy I put in and the energy I get out
balance. The energy put in by the microwave must balance the energy needed to heat the water. If
too little water, too much energy goes to thermal energy (too low a gear), if too much water, the microwave
isn't powerful enough to heat the water easily (up hill on hard gear)**
