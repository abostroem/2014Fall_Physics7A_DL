##Activity 2.1.1

-----------------------

### Goal: Understand PE and KE in mechanical systems

##A): Understand Internal Energy and mechanical energy

* **Read over the definitions in part A and look at the equation sheet handed out**

###Class Discussion

* **Are there any questions?**
* **What are the KE and PEgravity indicators? (velocity, height)**

##B): Dropping a golf ball

* **Perform the experiment described in section B and answer 1 and 2**

###Class Discussion

* **Can someone share their energy interaction diagram?**
* **What indicators and energy systems changed between the initial and final state?** velocity and height
* **Are these mechanical or internal?** all mech
* emphasize observable --> change in energy
* Make sure PE has gravity subscript
* friction and thermal are negligible
* Check signs in conservation of energy equation
* talk about initial states: just before, just after

##C): Dropping a coffee filter

* **Perform the experiment described in section C and answer questions 3 and 4**

###Class Discussion

* **Can someone share their energy interaction diagram?**
* **Why do we say one second after the filter is released?** (no change in KE, Ebond, change in PE --> change in Ethermal



###Small Groups

* **Think and discuss in your small groups #5 and #6**

###Class Discussion

* **What differences are there in your models for the golf ball and the coffee filter?**
	* no change in KE for coffee filter but change in Ethermal
	* **Where does the thermal energy coming from?** (friction and air resistance prop to SA/mass)
	* Note: Changes in thermal energy are inferred - EI diagrams and conservation of E equation really important
* **What mechanical energy systems depend only on magnitude of the indicator and in which are both magnitude and direction important?**
	* PE_gravity only decreases with deltah (in downward direction), horizontal movement has no effect, so direction of movement matters
	* KE, direction doesn't matter what direction is (use speed, not velocity)
