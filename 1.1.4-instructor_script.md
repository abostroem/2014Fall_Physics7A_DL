## Activity 1.1.4

-----------------------

### Goal:

* Use 3 phase model and energy interaction model to explain phenomena
* make sure everyone understand why

## A) Go over FNT 1.1.1 -1: Understanding the 3 phase model

- *Assign each group a part of B and C to write up (i, ii, iii, iv, and v), give one group part A to explain*

###Group Discussion:

* **alpha (FNT A) What happened at the corners of the graph? What is happening at A, B, and C?**
    * specify T and phase
    * Switched from degrees Celsius to Kelvin - 273K = 0C

* **beta (FNT B) What is happening at 765 kJ, 146kJ, and 1650kJ?**
		* Temperature
		* Phase (determine approx. percentage)
* **beta (FNT C) What are the initial and final conditions between C and B and A and C? How much
			energy did those transitions take?**

## B) Go over FNT 1.1.3-1: Understanding energy interaction model

* **Take the next 5 minutes to compare your solutions to 1.1.3 for both models. Make sure
		the two models agree and everyone understands and can explain why**
    * *Assign each group letters b, c, d, e, f, g to put on the board*
    * This should be a short class discussion

### Group Discussion

* *Have each group present their solutions*
    * **Did everyone agree on their solution**
    * **Any questions?**

### Highlights from 1.1.3:

* c.
    * discuss bond energy - increase (positive) when bonds are broken
    * line flat b/c phase change
* d.
    * sublimation - solid --> gas
    * reminder: bond energy - increase when bonds are broken

* e.
    * mixed state - not all of flat area (no delta T region) b/c only 25% liquid

* f, g.
    * Both thermal and bond energy are changing
