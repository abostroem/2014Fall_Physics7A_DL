### Goal: Calculations with Energy Interaction Diagram

##A) FNT 1.2.1-6 and FNT 1.2.1-7 Water, Ice, and Liquid Nitrogen
* *Half the class do one FNT, half the class do the other FNT*

###Class Discussion
* **FNT 1.2.1-6 - Put ice @-20 deg C into liquid Nitrogen (LN). What happens?**
	* **Why does it say a very large amount of LN?**
	* **Is deltaH heat of melting or heat of vaporization?**
	* Ice cools to LN temp, delta E_th --> delta E_bond --> some LN turns to gas
	* 4kg changes
	* Make sure students don't get lost in the math
	* **How can you check that the sign is correct?**

* **FNT 1.2.1 - Put ice @ -196 dec C into liquid water at 0 deg C. What happens?**
	* **What does a very large amount of water tell us?**
	* **Is deltaH heat of melting of heat of vaporization?**
	* Ice heats up to 0 deg C, some water turns to ice
	* 2.7 kg changes to ice
	* **How can you check that the sign is correct?**

##B) FNT 1.2.1-8: Liquid and Solid gold
* **How many people feel confident about their solutions?**
* **Is the final state solid, liquid, or mixed?**
* *Go to office hours table and discuss this with them*

###Class Discussion:

* **Can someone explain their answer and reasoning? What is the final state of the gold?**
* Consider 2 possibilities:
	* Solid goes to Tmp
		* What are the final temperatures at thermal equilibrium? (1336K)
		* What type of energy does this represent? (Ethemal)
	* Liquid all turns solid
		* What do you know about the final temperatures? (1000<Tf<1336)
		* What type of energy does this represent? (Ebond)
	* If E_thermal < E_bond what happens?
		* solid reached 1336 before phase transition happens --> final state is mixed
	* If E_thermal > E_bond what happens?
		* liquid all turns to solid then starts cooling --> final state is solid
	* What if E_thermal = E_bond?

* What do you need to calculate to determine the final state of your gold?
