##Activity 2.3.1

-----------------------

### Goal:
* Think about energy conservation as total energy = constant rather than no change in energy
* Think about zeropoint of height in PE

##1. Mini-lecture: Energy conservation as constant total energy
* *Derive total energy = constant for class*
	* start with deltas = 0, put initial on one side and final on the other to show they are equal

##2. Using Energy Conservation to graph energies for the falling ball

* **We are going to look at the effect of where you place y = 0**
* *Draw a sketch of the situation - don't label the y axis, just label separation*
* *Define interval*
* *Demonstrate for Y = 0 at 3 m below the floor*
* **Why can I draw a straight line?** PE_g only depends on height, so it's linear and since KE is proportional
to PE_g, it also is linear (not plotting KE vs velocity)
* Divide into groups
* Directions on the back of the page

Whole Class:
* **Why did we plot PE_g, E_tot, then KE?**
* **How did you determine E_tot?**
* **Explain using your plot how you know that change in PE + change in KE = 0 (or that total
energy is a constant for any y?**
* **How do the different plots compare - similarities/differences?**
	* KE is always the same
	* PE shifts from + to -
	* E tot shifts from + to -
* Don't need to go over all 6

##3. Repeat #2 for Mass/spring system

* **Take a minute to think about what shape you think PE and KE will have** quadratic b/c
PE_sm depends on square of the distance (which we are plotting)
* **What is our interval? (-2, 2)

* **Repeat #2 for a spring-mass system. You can use a displacement of 2**

###Whole Class:
* Set 0 at equilibrium
* **How did you find equilibrium?**
* **What is the shape of PE_sm and KE, E_tot?**
