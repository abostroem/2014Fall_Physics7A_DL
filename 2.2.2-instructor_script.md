##Activity 2.2.2

-----------------------

### Goal:
Practice using the model to interpret situations where your intuition fails

Assign one problem from the FNT to each table. Tell class that they will divide into groups
with one person from each group to explain the problem to the group.

###Whole Class
**Group 1**: FNT 2.2.1-1, 2.2.1-4, 2.2.1-2 - find the height of the ball, what if we set y = 0 at a different
place.

Answer to 2.2.1-1 = 6.5m
Answer to 2.2.1-4 = 4m
Answer to 2.2.1-2 = 7.1 m/s it doesn't matter where
* **What fundamental feature of the EI diagram accounts for why changing the location of y = 0
does not change your calculation of the balls max height?** (changes in energy --> change is height is important, not squared)
* **Why does it not important to divide the process?** (only care about end points of interval, looking at an average)

**Group 2**: FNT 2.2.1-3 - does it matter if the ball is going up or coming down?

* **Why does it not matter whether you look at the ball on its way up or down? How do you know the
speeds are the same?**
* should have 2 EI diagrams

**Group 3** FNT 2.2.1-5 - change in temperature of dropped balloon

Answer: deltaT = 0.05K (convert kJ to J)

* **Construct an EI diagram**

**Group 4** FNT 2.2.1-6a - mass spring - work to pull down

Answer: W = 5E-4 J

* **Construct an EI diagram**
* Open system

**Group 5** FNT 2.2.1-6b1 and b2 - mass spring moving through equilibrium in either direction

Answer: 6 cm/s

* **Construct Energy interaction diagram**
* closed system

**Group 6** FNT 2.2.1-6b3 - mass spring 5cm below equilibrium

Answer: 4 cm/s

* **Construct an Energy interaction diagram**
* closed system
