## Activity 1.1.5
-----------------------

### Goal: Use the 3 phase model and energy interaction model to explain the heat pack phenomenon

## A) Making Sense of the Heat Pack Cycle using our models

	- **Discuss FNT 1.1.3-2 with your group. Write up on the board the letter I assign you.
		You should put up both models**
	- *assign each group letter a, c, d, or e (NOT b)*
	- **Make sure your models agree and everyone can explain them to the group**

	### Whole Class
		- *Go around and have each group explain their step*
		- *Ask:*
			* **Did the energy of the system increase or decrease?**
			* **Is the system open or closed?**
			* **If open, does the energy come in or leave?**
			* **Compare the 2 models**
			* **How do both diagrams tell you about the sign of each term in the equation expressing energy conservation?**
				*stress that you know the sign of Q from whether the E increases or decreases

## B) Figuring out what happens when you activate your heat pack

	### alpha

		- **You are going to combine your sketches from 1.1.3-3 of the heat pack heating from solid to liquid
			in the hot pot and cooling without a phase change to room temperature (so it's still
			liquid).**
		- *Guide the groups to the right diagram before the whole class discussion*
		### Whole Class
			- *Make sure every group has the right diagram on their board*

	### beta

		- **You are going to determine what happens when you click the clicker. You are now
			assuming that your heat pack is thermally insulated**
		- *Don't talk about open or closed yet or tell them about interacting with environment*

		### Whole Class
			* **Who can explain using their EI diagram what happens when they click the clicker?**
			* **What do we know about heat in or heat out?**

	### Chi

		- ** Make an energy-system diagram for the clicking process**

		### Whole Class

			- **Who wants to share their energy system diagram?**
			- ** What tells you the graph of the activation should be a vertical line?**
			- *Discuss supercooling*
			- *Give example of superheating in microwave - water isn't boiling until you disturb it*
			- *Example of how a model gets extended*
			- **Where did the thermal energy come from when we clicked the clicker?**
			- *answer: bonds formed in phase change- NOT from clicking (this adds insignificant energy)

	### Delta

		- **Add the final part of the heating/cooling curve- cooling an activated heat pack to room temp**

		### Whole Class

			- **What does the T vs E diagram look like for the activated and cooling heat pack ?**
			- **Is it on top of the heating path?** Yes, it should be once it's been activated**

	### Epsilon

		- **Discuss the differences between the 3 phase model with and without supercooling**

		### Whole Class

			- **What differences did the different groups find?**
			- heating and cooling curves are identical without supercooling
			- supercooling --> liquid below melting point and sudden jump when activated
