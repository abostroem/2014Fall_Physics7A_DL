##Activity 1.2.1
-----------------------

### Goal:

	- Understand heat, heat capacity, change in temp
	- Connect heat capacity and thermal energy
	- differentiate heat capacity, molar heat capacity, and specific heat. What to use when
	- Connect delta H_vap and delta H_melt to delta E_bond


## A) Exploring Heat Capacity and Specific Heat

	- **Go to the next blue section of your lab 1.2.1**
	- **Go over questions 1-5 about heat capacity and specific heat and write notes on the board**
	- Feel out when to pause class to answer questions
	- **1. What does heat capacity mean?**
	- **2. Does a bucket of water or a tea cup of water have a greater heat capacity? What about specific heat?**
		- mention extensive (changes with volume) and intensive (volumen independent)
	- **3. Make an energy system diagram for the bucket system**
	- **4. Determine an algebraic expression for heat capacity**
	- **5. Determine an algebraic expression for mass and molar heat capacity. When would you use one or the other?**

## B) Heats of Vaporization and Melting

	- Delta H is the amount of energy added or removed at a phase change
	- **Go over questions 1-5 in part B together, we will stop periodically to discuss**
	- Feel out when to pause class to answer questions
	- **1. What does "heat of melting" and "heat of vaporization" mean?**
	- **2. What does the energy system diagram look like for  a phase change say solid --> liquid**
	- **3. If delta H were expressed per unit mass (or mole) how would your delta H = Q equation change?
		* here we are changing H from an extensive to intensive quantity. H can be expressed either way, be careful
			of the context
	- **4. Use equations in #2 and #3 to get an expression for bond energy using the indicator
		of the bond energy system (the mass that changed phase) and the heat of vaporization or
		heat of melting**
		* This is a tricky questions to understand

	- **5. Using the energy conservation equation you found in 1.1.5C for the triggering process (FNT 1.1.3-2b)
		and the equations you found in parts A and B of 1.2.1 to rewrite the energy conservation equation in terms
		of C and H. Which variables have you already found and which ones do you need?**
		* Just need C and delta H
		* delta H is negative - make sure students justify
