##Activity 2.1.3

-----------------------

### Goal:
* More practice with PE and KE and using an Energy interaction diagram to avoid making mistakes
based on intuition.

##A) FNT 2.1.1-1 - 3 rocks

* Put answers to b-g on the board

### Class Discussion
* **b. What are the indicators and energy systems in this problem?**
	* KE, speed; PE_g, h
* **c. Can someone explain their energy system diagram and equations?**
* **d, e. Are there any differences in the energy system diagrams for the 3 rocks?**
	* No
* **f. What can you predict with certainty based on your model?**
	* **What might you need to include in your model?**
	* **What is different about the final states of the 3 balls?**
* **g. What differences did you have between your predictions and the model's predictions?**
	* balls travel different distance
	* direction of velocity doesn't matter
	* **Remember we are looking at changes in energy, not absolute values of KE or PE**
	* **this is an example of the usefulness of the energy interaction diagram - our intuition doesn't
	always serve us.**

##B) FNT 2.1.1-2 - Bucket of water
* **Discuss a and b with your group and write answer on the board**

###Class Discussion

* **Who can explain their equations for work and force?**
	* Mention Force and delta x are in the same direction - to be covered more in 7b. They will
	always be parallel in this class
	* Easier to explain with an energy interaction diagram, improve communication
	* Include:
		* Only one energy system is changing
		* open system b/c work is being done?
		* work = change in PE_g
##C) Toy car launcher
* **Read through part C and answer the questions on the board**

Class Discussion:
* **What determines what speed the cars leave the launcher at? How did you determine this?**
	* Mass (PE_ms = KE), intuitively heavier things move more slowly
* **Can someone explain their energy interaction diagrams?**
