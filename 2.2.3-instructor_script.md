##Activity 2.2.3

-----------------------

### Goal:
* Practice using EI diagrams
* Realizing that models can get them to the correct answer when intuition may not

##1) Predict and Experiment
* **Consider a lighter and a heavier mass connected to a string strung over a frictionless
pulley. If the masses are initially at rest and we let one go, which one will hit the ground first? Make predictions
for 2 different sets of masses: 200 and 220g and 70 and 50 g**
* Put predictions on the board
* Try it. *Group tables and race (make sure there are enough masses)*

###Whole Class
* **What predictions did people have? Why? Any explanations?**
* **Now let's see if we can explain it using an energy interaction model and conservation of energy**

##2) Apply the Energy Interaction Model

* **Make an energy interaction diagram on the board**
* Make sure groups get physical system and interval correct

###Class Discussion
* **Who can explain why the smaller masses moved faster than the slower masses?**
* **What energy systems did you ignore?** (E_th (air + friction), KE_rot)
* **How does the net change in KE compare for the two trials?** Same
* **Who can explain how they checked the sign of the terms in their equation using their EI diagram?**
* **What is happening to the net KE of the systems over the interval in both trials?** net increase for both
* **How does the net change in KE compare for the two trials?** Same
* **How does the KE term relate to the masses of the weights?** sum of weights
* **How does the PE term relate to the masses of the weights?** difference of weights
* **What is happening to the net PE of the system over the interval in both trials?** net decrease
* Don't go over #10 in class
