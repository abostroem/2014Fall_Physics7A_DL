##Activity 1.1.7

-----------------------

### Goal: Extend the model to chemical reactions

##A) FNT 1.1.4-1 (this part is a really short discussion)
* **Looking at the chemical reaction as a whole is bond energy increasing or decreasing?**

###Class Discussion
* **1 if energy is increasing 5 if energy is decreasing. Why?**
* heat is produced and phase change --> bond energy decreased

##B) FNT 1.1.4-2
* **Do a, b, and c**

###Class Discussion
* **When a bond is formed, what can you say with certainty about the change in bond energy?**
	* forming bond --> decrease bond energy, breaking bond --> increase bond energy
* **Who can explain their energy system diagram for the chemical reaction?**
	* 4 bond energy systems
	* RHS forms bonds --> decrease in E bond
	* LHS breaks bonds --> increase in E bond
* **Did you find that the total bond energy of the system increased or decreased after
the chemical reaction?** (decreased, negative heat of the system)
	* Connection between chemistry and physics - its the same thing
