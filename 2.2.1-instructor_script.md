##Activity 2.2.1

-----------------------

### Goal:

##A): Discuss one question at a time in small group and as a class

* **What are the indicators? What are they measured relative to?**
* **Which of these depend on the square of an indicator? In other words, in which of these
	is the direction of the change in indicator important?**
	* Talk about even and odd powers
* **Which energy system depends on mass and which on weight?**
	* PE_g depends on weight
	* PE_g, KE, PE_spring-mass depend on mass
* **What did people find for #4 and #5? Were the values the same?**
	* 4- set PE_g equal to Work - height
	* 5 - set KE = Work - speed
	* Discuss individuals speeds are squared, not the square of the difference

##B): Construct an energy system diagram of throwing a ball in the air

###Class Discussion

* **Can someone present their energy system diagram to the class?**
	* label initial and final positions and speeds
	* define interval
	* check signs
	* solve for height
