##Activity 2.1.4

-----------------------

### Goal: Understanding general applications of the Energy Interaction diagram

##A) Work on A, and reflect on our use of energy interaction diagrams

###Class Discussion

* **What is useful to think about before starting an energy system diagram?**
	* Physical System
	* Interval
	* Open or closed
	* Energy systems and indicators

##B) Thinking about how to create an energy system diagram
* **Create and think about an energy system diagram for a mass/spring system in part B**

###Class Discussion
* **Who wants to share their diagram and thought process?**
* **What decisions did you have to make?**
	* physical system, interval, what to include
* **What can you used your model to answer and what do you need more information to answer?**

##C) Rolling Cue Balls
* **Perform the experiment in C and use the Energy Interaction Model to explain what is going on**

* **Who wants to explain their energy interaction diagram to the class?**
	* PE_g decreases by the same amount for both balls
	* One ball arrives at bottom faster --> moving faster
	* Where did other energy come from? Rotation
	* Assume frictionless
