##Activity 1.2.2

-----------------------

### Goal:
* Quantitative practice with models
* differentiating energy and power


##A: FNT 1.2.1-1
* **Discuss FNT 1.2.1-1**
* less than 3 min

###Class Discusion
* **Is the statement: "The energy that is transferred as heat to or from the object with the larger
heat capacity must be greater than the energy that is transferred as heat to or from the object
with the smaller heat capacity** (false, energy is the same)
	* Closed system
	* **What is the effect of the different heat capacities?**

## B: FNT 1.2.1-2
* **Look at handout 1.2.2 and complete a and b**
	* **This is a good example of how much work you should show on the board**
	* **Being able to construct the correct diagram and get the first 3 lines of algebra
	(including verifying the signs of the terms in the third line) are worth most of the credit on an exam)**
	* **Concepts are more important than algebra and plugging into equations**
* **The short interval is going to 43 deg C**

###Class Discussion
* **Are there any questions on a?**
* **Can someone explain their Energy System diagram?**
* **Using your temperature v E diagrams, What in the process connects the two final temperatures?**
	* Reach the final temperature at the same time

## C: FNT 1.2.1-3
* ** Discuss a, b, and c in your small groups**
	* *walk around an answer questions*

### Class Discussion
* **Is it valid to have indicators that do not correspond to the whole interval? why?**
	* yes, its ok if shorter and all processes covered?
* **What is the difference between power and energy?**
	t = 143s

## D: FNT 1.2.1-4
* **Discuss alpha and beta**
* **Don't do any calculations for alpha**

### Class Discussion:
* **alpha: Why can't you apply the energy interaction diagram in a straightforward way?**
* **beta: How can you use the energy interaction diagram on shorter intervals to explain this process?**
	* Think about energy as money - what systems could there be?
